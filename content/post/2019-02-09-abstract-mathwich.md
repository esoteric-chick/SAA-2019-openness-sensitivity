Complex systems approaches to archaeological interpretation are well-established in the discipline and offer important ways for studying change over various scales. Large datasets and regional syntheses invite new applications of complex systems to archaeological data. At the same time, indigenous and postcolonial perspectives have increasingly become foundational to project planning, data collection, and interpretation. Despite the importance of these two approaches to contemporary archaeology, researchers seldom interpret complex systems concepts and methods through indigenous ontological frameworks. The lack of substantial dialogue between these theoretical approaches results in uncritical applications of complexity theory which inadvertently reinforce scripts of settler colonialism. This paper reviews legacy faunal data from southern Arizona to challenge the prehistoric/historic break often used in the interpretation of archaeological materials. This case study of data reinterpretation examines how careful data sharing and indigenous perspectives can inform interpretations of state shifts in complex systems and colonialism.
