In Cultural Resources Management, many archaeological survey projects are undertaken through contract services provided to regional federal clients with large-scale resource evaluation needs. In the case of military properties, each installation maintains SOPs and curatorial operations to serve the needs of their unique CRM department. While modern military and government security may exist at the forefront of on-the-ground practice at these locations, the historical research and archaeological data related to historic and precolonial communities and individuals that once resided on these properties should be handled with equal sensitivity. This paper examines practical digital strategies implemented at military installation sites in the southeastern United States to protect the legacy of those who lived in the past as well as those who are working to protect sites for the future, through the processes of resource evaluation, management, and interpretation for the public.
