      <description>Nicole Mathwich, Ph.D. Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona, Tuscon, AZ ABSTRACT
Complex systems approaches to archaeological interpretation are well-established in the discipline and offer important ways for studying change over various scales. Large datasets and regional syntheses invite new applications of complex systems applications of complex systems to archaeological data. At the same time, indigenous and postcolonial perspectives have increasingly become foundational to project planning, data collection, and interpretation.</description>
