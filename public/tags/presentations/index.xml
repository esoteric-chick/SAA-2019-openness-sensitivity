      <description>In Cultural Resources Management, many archaeological survey projects are undertaken through contract services provided to regional federal clients with large-scale resource evaluation needs. In the case of military properties, each installation maintains SOPs and curatorial operations to serve the needs of their unique CRM department. While modern military and government security may exist at the forefront of on-the-ground practice at these locations, the historical research and archaeological data related to historic and precolonial communities and individuals that once resided on these properties should be handled with equal sensitivity.</description>

Introduction: With the rise of the digital age, new possibilities for expanding the accessibility and long-term sustainability of archaeological data have emerged. A body of literature over the past ten years has contributed to important debates about the role of digitization of, open access to, and community engagement with both digitized and born-digital archaeological data (Beale 2012; Beck and Neylon 2012; Bevan 2012; Costa, et al.</description>

      <description>David Gadsby National Park Service Appropriate stewardship of sensitive archeological data necessarily involves overlapping and intertwined authorities, systems, and institutions. The authorities, in turn have different limits and requirements, while various entities have divergent purposes, needs, and protocols. Archeologists, librarians, data managers, planners, and resource managers who work with sensitive data require a thorough understanding of the nature of both the physical and digital resources and the contexts in which they are embedded.</description>

      <description>Nicole Mathwich, Ph.D. Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona, Tuscon, AZ ABSTRACT
Complex systems approaches to archaeological interpretation are well-established in the discipline and offer important ways for studying change over various scales. Large datasets and regional syntheses invite new applications of complex systems applications of complex systems to archaeological data. At the same time, indigenous and postcolonial perspectives have increasingly become foundational to project planning, data collection, and interpretation.</description>
