      <description>The Chaco Research Archive (CRA, chacoarchive.org) has been available since 2004 and the Salmon Pueblo Archaeological Research Collection (SPARC, salmonpueblo.org) launched in May of 2018. These web-based portals, as their names indicate, were both designed primarily with the academic researcher in mind. While these resources acknowledge the diverse descendant communities within the Southwest, neither has deliberately focused on eliciting robust Native perspectives to coincide with Euro-American forms of archaeological classification and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Abstract: How do we keep “bro-ing” away from open access archaeology?: Open Access, Cultural Appropriation, and Archaeology</title>

      <description>Open access archaeology helps make archaeological data available to larger research communities. While this is commendable, much of our work in the United States is generated from research conducted on indigenous, descendant, or non-European American communities, many of which have histories of negative interactions with anthropologists and archaeologists. This paper explores protocols for preventing cultural knowledge from disproportionately benefitting archaeologists and keeping cultural knowledge from being used in ways that do not benefit descendant and indigenous communities.</description>

      <description>In Cultural Resources Management, many archaeological survey projects are undertaken through contract services provided to regional federal clients with large-scale resource evaluation needs. In the case of military properties, each installation maintains SOPs and curatorial operations to serve the needs of their unique CRM department. While modern military and government security may exist at the forefront of on-the-ground practice at these locations, the historical research and archaeological data related to historic and precolonial communities and individuals that once resided on these properties should be handled with equal sensitivity.</description>
