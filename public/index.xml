      <description>The Chaco Research Archive (CRA, chacoarchive.org) has been available since 2004 and the Salmon Pueblo Archaeological Research Collection (SPARC, salmonpueblo.org) launched in May of 2018. These web-based portals, as their names indicate, were both designed primarily with the academic researcher in mind. While these resources acknowledge the diverse descendant communities within the Southwest, neither has deliberately focused on eliciting robust Native perspectives to coincide with Euro-American forms of archaeological classification and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Abstract: How do we keep “bro-ing” away from open access archaeology?: Open Access, Cultural Appropriation, and Archaeology</title>

      <description>Open access archaeology helps make archaeological data available to larger research communities. While this is commendable, much of our work in the United States is generated from research conducted on indigenous, descendant, or non-European American communities, many of which have histories of negative interactions with anthropologists and archaeologists. This paper explores protocols for preventing cultural knowledge from disproportionately benefitting archaeologists and keeping cultural knowledge from being used in ways that do not benefit descendant and indigenous communities.</description>

      <title>Abstract: Negotiating Complexity in the Management of Sensitive Digital Data</title>

      <description>Appropriate stewardship of sensitive archeological data necessarily involves overlapping and intertwined authorities, systems, and institutions. The authorities, in turn have different limits and requirements, while various entities have divergent purposes, needs, and protocols. Archeologists, librarians, data managers, planners, and resource managers who work with sensitive data require a thorough understanding of the nature of both the physical and digital resources and the contexts in which they are embedded. Healthy institutional relationships and the effective communication that comes with those relationships are as critical to ensuring appropriate access to data as they are to protecting them from unwanted disclosure.</description>

      <title>Abstract: Open Data, Indigenous Knowledge, and Archaeology: The need for community-driven open data projects</title>

      <description>Over the past 20 years, much archaeological data has been digitized and made available online. With an increasing call for open data and open science models, driven largely by a desire to make research more accessible and reproduceable, archaeologists are exploring new ways to make these data available without negative impacts to the archaeological record. However, when archaeologists work in Indigenous contexts, there are considerations about how broadly knowledge should be shared, especially when it concerns deceased ancestors.</description>

      <description>Complex systems approaches to archaeological interpretation are well-established in the discipline and offer important ways for studying change over various scales. Large datasets and regional syntheses invite new applications of complex systems to archaeological data. At the same time, indigenous and postcolonial perspectives have increasingly become foundational to project planning, data collection, and interpretation. Despite the importance of these two approaches to contemporary archaeology, researchers seldom interpret complex systems concepts and methods through indigenous ontological frameworks.</description>

      <title>Abstract: Respecting the Past and Protecting the Future: Strategies for Implementing Digital Best Practices in Historical Archaeology Research on Military Installations</title>

      <description>In Cultural Resources Management, many archaeological survey projects are undertaken through contract services provided to regional federal clients with large-scale resource evaluation needs. In the case of military properties, each installation maintains SOPs and curatorial operations to serve the needs of their unique CRM department. While modern military and government security may exist at the forefront of on-the-ground practice at these locations, the historical research and archaeological data related to historic and precolonial communities and individuals that once resided on these properties should be handled with equal sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Abstract: Why We Should Reassess How We Define Sensitive Archaeological Data and How We Share It</title>

      <description>We all want to be published and want our archeological research to be relevant, useful, and available to other archeologists, but in this digital age, it may be too easy to share, and too easy for sensitive site location information to end up in places that could cause irreparable harm to the archeology that we are so passionate about. We tend to write our reports for an archeological audience, including all kinds of useful information about where we found those wonderful artifacts and unique features.</description>

      <description>Electronic Symposium Format This session is an electronic symposium at the 2019 Society for American Archaeology Conference in Albuquerque, NM. As an electronic symposium, the format is a bit different than regular sessions. Full papers won&amp;rsquo;t be read during the two hour session. Instead, papers, graphics, and other content will be posted here. Participants will give brief presentations, but most time will be allotted for discussion materials gathered on this website.</description>
