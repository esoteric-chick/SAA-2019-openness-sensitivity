Introduction: With the rise of the digital age, new possibilities for expanding the accessibility and long-term sustainability of archaeological data have emerged. A body of literature over the past ten years has contributed to important debates about the role of digitization of, open access to, and community engagement with both digitized and born-digital archaeological data (Beale 2012; Beck and Neylon 2012; Bevan 2012; Costa, et al.</description>

      <description>Anne M. Wolley Vawser Midwest Archeological Center National Park Service Think back to your first field school when you learned the basics of archeological investigations, whether it was excavating a roman ruin or conducting pedestrian survey in some western US state. Your professors and TAs were always after you to document, document, document through field notes and forms, and maybe later you were lucky enough to help write up part of the report of your findings.</description>

      <title>Negotiating Complexity in the Management of Sensitive Digital Data</title>

      <description>David Gadsby National Park Service Appropriate stewardship of sensitive archeological data necessarily involves overlapping and intertwined authorities, systems, and institutions. The authorities, in turn have different limits and requirements, while various entities have divergent purposes, needs, and protocols. Archeologists, librarians, data managers, planners, and resource managers who work with sensitive data require a thorough understanding of the nature of both the physical and digital resources and the contexts in which they are embedded.</description>

      <description>Nicole Mathwich, Ph.D. Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona, Tuscon, AZ ABSTRACT
Complex systems approaches to archaeological interpretation are well-established in the discipline and offer important ways for studying change over various scales. Large datasets and regional syntheses invite new applications of complex systems applications of complex systems to archaeological data. At the same time, indigenous and postcolonial perspectives have increasingly become foundational to project planning, data collection, and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Abstract: Chacoan Complexities</title>

      <description>The Chaco Research Archive (CRA, chacoarchive.org) has been available since 2004 and the Salmon Pueblo Archaeological Research Collection (SPARC, salmonpueblo.org) launched in May of 2018. These web-based portals, as their names indicate, were both designed primarily with the academic researcher in mind. While these resources acknowledge the diverse descendant communities within the Southwest, neither has deliberately focused on eliciting robust Native perspectives to coincide with Euro-American forms of archaeological classification and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Abstract: How do we keep “bro-ing” away from open access archaeology?: Open Access, Cultural Appropriation, and Archaeology</title>

      <description>Open access archaeology helps make archaeological data available to larger research communities. While this is commendable, much of our work in the United States is generated from research conducted on indigenous, descendant, or non-European American communities, many of which have histories of negative interactions with anthropologists and archaeologists. This paper explores protocols for preventing cultural knowledge from disproportionately benefitting archaeologists and keeping cultural knowledge from being used in ways that do not benefit descendant and indigenous communities.</description>

      <title>Abstract: Respecting the Past and Protecting the Future: Strategies for Implementing Digital Best Practices in Historical Archaeology Research on Military Installations</title>

      <description>In Cultural Resources Management, many archaeological survey projects are undertaken through contract services provided to regional federal clients with large-scale resource evaluation needs. In the case of military properties, each installation maintains SOPs and curatorial operations to serve the needs of their unique CRM department. While modern military and government security may exist at the forefront of on-the-ground practice at these locations, the historical research and archaeological data related to historic and precolonial communities and individuals that once resided on these properties should be handled with equal sensitivity.</description>

      <description>Electronic Symposium Format This session is an electronic symposium at the 2019 Society for American Archaeology Conference in Albuquerque, NM. As an electronic symposium, the format is a bit different than regular sessions. Full papers won&amp;rsquo;t be read during the two hour session. Instead, papers, graphics, and other content will be posted here. Participants will give brief presentations, but most time will be allotted for discussion materials gathered on this website.</description>
